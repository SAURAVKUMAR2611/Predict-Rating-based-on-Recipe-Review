Data Analysis and Machine Learning Workflow

## Description

This Jupyter Notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of a data analysis and machine learning workflow. It covers essential steps such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The project aims to offer insights into predictive modeling using real-world data.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Efficiently handles missing data and ensures the dataset is prepared for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides visualizations and summary statistics to understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering**: Implements feature scaling and transformations to improve model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trains machine learning models and evaluates them using appropriate metrics.

## Libraries Used

The notebook utilizes the following Python libraries:

- `numpy` - For numerical computations.
- `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib` - For data visualization.
- `seaborn` - For statistical plotting.
- `sklearn` - For machine learning algorithms and utilities.
